# Planets Info

This app shows you information about planets in solar system. 

### Technologies

Here I used functional components in React and I used React-routs to make different pages for planets. The app uses API to get information about planets.

### Features

Here is nine pages in this project, navigated by React-routes. There is not much interaction in this project. You can only switch between pages, my goal on this project was to use API with React and work with navigation between different pages.
